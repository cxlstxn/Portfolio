                    <p>Scotbank is my proudest project to date, developed as part of a university class ran by JPMorgan. Our team was tasked with designing and building a functional banking interface that mimicked real-world systems, combining front-end design with robust back-end logic.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The front-end of the Scotbank project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on creating a clean, intuitive user interface that mimicked the experience of a real banking app. A combination of css and tailwind was used to create a sleek and user-friendly design. The frontend was able to effectively communicate to the back-end by using the handlebars framework.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The back-end was built in Java, using tools like Jooby to communicate with the frontend and Maven to handle dependencies and build the project. As well as a Server memory-based SQL database which kept hold of users details. We were also provided api's from the JPMorgan team, all from different formats, XML, JSON and CSV.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This project really helped me learn how important micro-management can be when working on large scale like this, especially when it comes to coordinating between different people and ensuring that everyone is on the same page.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Overall, Scotbank was a challenging but rewarding project that taught me a lot about full-stack development, teamwork, and the importance of user experience in software design. It was a great opportunity to apply my skills in a real-world context and learn from industry professionals.</p>
